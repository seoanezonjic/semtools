comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

The fruiting body is part of the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle, with the rest of the life cycle being characterized by vegetative mycelial growth. The sporocarp of a basidiomycete is known as a basidiocarp, while the fruiting body of an ascomycete is known as an ascocarp. A significant range of different shapes and morphologies is found in both basidiocarps and ascocarps; these features play an important role in the identification and taxonomy of fungi."

comment: To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

name: response to acid chemical
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus by the chemical structure of the anion portion of a dissociated acid (rather than the acid acting as a proton donor). The acid chemical may be in gaseous, liquid or solid form." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:rn]
comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0010447 'response to acidic pH' instead.

comment: Transcription termination sites can be recognized by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) itself or by another protein which interacts with the RNAP to promote transcription termination. Note that not all genes have a DNA specific sequence that functions as a termination site; for most mRNAs transcribed by RNAP II termination is not mediated by a specific termination sequence, but is coupled to polyadenylation.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts. For example, focal adhesions and focal contacts do not display a core structure of F-actin. Unlike focal adhesions, podosome assembly does not require de novo protein synthesis. However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.

comment: In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.

def: "A series of reactions that takes place outside the cell occurring in response to tissue damage and initiated within blood plasma by the action of activated Factor XII (Hageman Factor) on prekallikrein to convert it to plasma kallikrein, and the subsequent reaction of plasma kallikrein with high molecular weight kininogen. The ultimate product of the plasma kallikrein-kinin cascade is bradykinin, an agent known to induce smooth muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and increased vascular permeability."

name: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
namespace: biological_process
def: "An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing specific receptors for antigen produced through a somatic diversification process that includes somatic recombination of germline gene segments encoding immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus." [GOC:add, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0781735149, ISBN:1405196831]

comment: In E. coli, two genes are involved, nuvA (aka Thi) and NuvC (aka iscS) . NuvA converts the trNA into an unidentified intermediate in an ATP dependent manner. NucC catalyzes the second step, transferring the sulfur from cysteine to an unidentified intermediate. NuvC also participates in thiamine synthesis.
